    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧬 Problem Statement: Why Antimicrobial Peptide Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins that play a crucial role in the innate immune system of all living organisms. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural antibiotics**: Part of the body's first line of defense against pathogens\n",
    "- **Broad-spectrum**: Effective against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and even cancer cells\n",
    "- **Fast-acting**: Kill microbes within minutes\n",
    "- **Low resistance**: Pathogens develop resistance much slower compared to conventional antibiotics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is This Problem Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Antibiotic Resistance Crisis** 🚨\n",
    "- Traditional antibiotics are becoming ineffective due to bacterial resistance\n",
    "- WHO lists antibiotic resistance as one of the top 10 global public health threats\n",
    "- By 2050, antimicrobial resistance could cause 10 million deaths annually\n",
    "- **AMPs offer a promising alternative** with lower resistance development\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Drug Discovery** 💊\n",
    "- Identifying AMPs from protein sequences can accelerate drug development\n",
    "- Computational prediction is **faster and cheaper** than experimental screening\n",
    "- Can screen millions of sequences in silico before lab testing\n",
    "- Reduces time from discovery to clinical trials\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Personalized Medicine** 🏥\n",
    "- Understanding human AMPs helps in:\n",
    "  - Diagnosing immune deficiencies\n",
    "  - Developing targeted therapies\n",
    "  - Understanding disease susceptibility\n",
    "  - Creating personalized treatment plans\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Agricultural Applications** 🌾\n",
    "- AMPs can protect crops from pathogens\n",
    "- Reduce need for chemical pesticides\n",
    "- Improve food security\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Computational Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Given a protein sequence, can we predict whether it has antimicrobial properties?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Machine Learning?**\n",
    "- Experimental validation is expensive (\\$10,000+ per peptide)\n",
    "- Time-consuming (months to years)\n",
    "- ML can screen thousands of candidates in hours\n",
    "- Accuracy of 80-95% can significantly reduce experimental workload\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Impact**:\n",
    "- Pharmaceutical companies use these models to identify drug candidates\n",
    "- Researchers discover new AMPs from genomic databases\n",
    "- Helps combat emerging infectious diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",

    "\n",
    "**Balanced Dataset**: Equal number of samples per class (1,000 each)\n",
    "- Prevents bias toward majority class\n",
    "- Ensures fair model training\n",
    "- Simplifies evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Label 1 (AMP)**: Mean = 505 aa, Median = 387 aa\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biological Context\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Makes a Protein Antimicrobial?\n",
    "\n",
    "AMPs typically have these characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positive Charge**\n",
    "   - Rich in lysine (K) and arginine (R)\n",
    "   - Attracts to negatively charged bacterial membranes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Amphipathic Structure**\n",
    "   - Contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions\n",
    "   - Allows insertion into lipid membranes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Small to Medium Size**\n",
    "   - Typically 10-50 amino acids (though our dataset includes larger proteins)\n",
    "   - Easier to penetrate cell membranes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Specific Amino Acid Composition**\n",
    "   - High content of: K, R, W, F, L\n",
    "   - Low content of: E, D (negatively charged)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mechanism of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "AMPs kill microbes by:\n",
    "1. **Membrane Disruption**: Creating pores in bacterial membranes\n",
    "2. **Intracellular Targets**: Inhibiting DNA/RNA synthesis\n",
    "3. **Immune Modulation**: Activating immune responses\n",

    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Model Training\n",
    "Train three classifiers on each feature set:\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression**: Linear baseline\n",
    "2. **Random Forest**: Non-linear ensemble method\n",

    "\n",
    "**Total**: 3 features × 3 classifiers = 9 models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4: Evaluation\n",
    "Evaluate models using:\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness\n",
    "- **Precision**: How many predicted AMPs are actually AMPs?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Part 5: Visualization & Interpretation\n",
    "- Compare performance across features and classifiers\n",
    "- Generate ROC curves\n",
    "- Create confusion matrices\n",
    "- Visualize embeddings (PCA)\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Background: Feature Extraction Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Different Features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different features capture different aspects of protein sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | What it Captures | Best For |\n",
    "|---------|------------------|----------|\n",
    "| **AAC** | Overall composition | Quick baseline, interpretable |\n",
    "| **k-mer** | Local patterns, motifs | Functional sites, domains |\n",
    "| **ProtVec** | Semantic relationships | Complex patterns, context |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution of Protein Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **1990s**: Hand-crafted features (AAC, physicochemical properties)\n",
    "2. **2000s**: Sequence-based features (k-mers, position-specific)\n",
    "3. **2010s**: Embedding methods (ProtVec, inspired by NLP)\n",
    "4. **2020s**: Deep learning (ESM, ProtBERT - transformers)\n",

    "## 🔬 Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on similar studies, you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Expected F1-Score | Why? |\n",
    "|---------|-------------------|------|\n",
    "| AAC | 0.65 - 0.75 | Simple features, limited information |\n",
    "| k-mer | 0.75 - 0.85 | Captures local patterns |\n",
    "| ProtVec | 0.80 - 0.88 | Learned representations, semantic meaning |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Classifier**: Usually Random Forest or SVM (non-linear methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Simple**: Implement AAC first, then move to more complex features\n",
    "2. **Test Incrementally**: Test each function with a small example before running on full dataset\n",
    "3. **Use Random Seeds**: Set `random_state=42` everywhere for reproducibility\n",
    "4. **Standardize Features**: Always scale features before training (use `StandardScaler`)\n",
    "5. **Cross-Validate**: Don't rely only on test set performance\n",
    "6. **Visualize**: Plots help you understand what's happening\n",
    "7. **Compare**: The goal is to compare different approaches, not just get high accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Splitting**:\n",
    "- Training: 80% (1,600 sequences)\n",
    "- Testing: 20% (400 sequences)\n",
    "- Use stratified split to maintain class balance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Seed**: 42 (for reproducibility)\n",
